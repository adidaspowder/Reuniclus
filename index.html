    <h2>What is a Pokemon?</h2>
    <p>Pokemon was created by Satoshi Taijiri and Ken Sugimori. Satoshi had created a magazine called Game Freak in the 1980’s which later became a game company. In the early 90’s, Satoshi thought of the idea of pocket monsters and pitched it to Nintendo. They agreed to work with him and in 1996 two pokemon games released for the Nintendo Gameboy only in Japan. Later that year, the Pokemon Trading Card Game was released in Japan as well. In 1997, an anime series launched on TV in Japan based on Pokemon. In the late 90’s Pokemon hit the American shores with the english releases of the two original pokemon games and trading card game. The game sold millions of copies worldwide and the anime brought pokemon in as a mainstay in 90’s pop culture. But What is a Pokemon? Pokemon are creatures based on plants, mythological creatures, lots of animals, and even inanimate objects. They are held in objects called pokeballs and used to battle other pokemon. These creatures can evolve into stronger versions that have more abilities and types. There are currently 19 types of pokemon, ranging from grass and bug type to dragon and steel. Pokemon can have one or two types and some have been known to switch types over time and through different generations of pokemon.

    <h2>What pokemon are you talking about?</h2>
    <p>Reuniclus is a pokemon that was released during Generation 5 of Pokemon. This is known as the black and white era as those were the mainline games to be released. The pokemon is and always has been a psychic type. It is the stage two, aka final stage, of a pokemon called solosis. The pokemon seems to be surrounded by a green translucent substance and their arms extend out past the little nubs the pokemon inside the blob has. The entire evolution line of this pokemon seems to revolve around the idea of the process of which a fetus grows where it starts as a cell and grows into a fetus.The overall design of this Pokemon has relatively stayed the same over the 10+ years it has been around. It has no regional differences or changes as well. This pokemon was seen in the Pokemon anime during the Black and White period having major and minor appearances. This pokemon has had only 7 cards since its start in the Trading Card game. In a recent set, it has gotten a full art which is refreshing as this pokemon was missing from the TCG sphere for almost 10 years. Below will be a gallery of those cards.</p>

    <h2>Merchandise</h2>
    <p>There has not been much merchandise made on this Pokémon through the years. The Pokémon center in Japan have seen some keychains and a prize plush could've been won from claw machines in Japan in the early to mid 2010’s. In more recent times, Pokémon center began releasing a line of plushies called Sitting Cuties. The plush were (hopefully) able to sit and were mini sizes of Pokémon. When generation five of Sitting Cuties was released, Reuniclus and its evolution line were included. This past year, a collection of merchandise only released in Japan called Psycho Cyber included Reuniclus and its evolution line. This collection includes hoodies, t-shirts, stickers, bags, and even a light-up figure.</p>
