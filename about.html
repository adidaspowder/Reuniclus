                        Hi, I’m Loren! I am a student at the University of Oregon. I am just finishing up my first computer science class. I am originally from Florida and I have just started to explore the west coast. One of my biggest current hobbies is collecting Pokémon. I have joined the Pokémon club at UO. I also play video games and I love to take naps. I have a knack for cooking and used to bake. I am planning to major in math with a minor in computer information technology but currently I am undecided. I took this Computer Science class to explore fields and to see if I enjoyed computer science.

                        Recently, I have started to collect Pokémon cards again. After opening pack after pack seeing new Pokémon, I began to see some Pokémon that I recognized. Then I saw him, Reuniclus. This was a Pokémon that I dearly remembered from my childhood. So then it became an addiction for me. I bought a plushie, keychains and collected even more cards of that specific Pokémon. I think it struck me so much because I think Reuniclus was a really common card that I had a lot of repeat cards of. There are other Pokémon that I like and collect but Reuniclus holds a place in my heart that it will always have. I am currently trying to get more merchandise of this Pokémon but most of it is exclusive to Japan so I have to both wait and pay high prices for it to be exported to America. Other than Reuniclus I have also started collecting full art Pikachu cards, I have recently collected a lot of celebration cards where it uses the older Pikachu design. I like collecting those because they are cheap and cute.
